# after creating configure.ac & Makefile.am, now we can run
# autoreconf -i
# to generate configure and Makefile.in, etc, but note some
# files still needed to be created, such as README, ChangeLog..
# Then we can build the program by ./configure && make
# Also autoreconf generated some great capabilities such as:
# DESTDIR="$t" make install
# DESTDIR="$t" make uninstall
# make distcheck   # Check beore release
# make dist        # Creates distribution tarball.
